## Description of Project
Our budget and savings manager is designed to be a personal finance tracker. It will help users track income, monitor their spending habits, create and manage budgets, and set savings goals. The goal of our project is to make healthy and responsible financial habits easier to achieve. It provides a simple way to categorize and track transactions while sending necessary alerts to users about overspending or falling behind on savings goals. The project will use exception handling to prevent invalid inputs and overspending.
