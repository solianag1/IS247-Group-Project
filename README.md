## Project Description
Our budget and savings manager is a personal finance tracker. It allows users to track income, monitor their spending habits, create and manage budgets, and set savings goals. The goal of our project is to make healthy and responsible financial habits easier to achieve. It provides a simple way to categorize and track transactions while sending necessary alerts to users about overspending or falling behind on savings goals. The project will use exception handling to prevent invalid inputs like negative amounts, or overspending beyond the set monthly budget.
